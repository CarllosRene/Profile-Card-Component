# Profile-Card-Component

Based on my basic knowledge about HTML and CSS in order to develop my skills.
I couldn't make it responsive properly on small screens. The idea was to put the background similar to the desktop version,
but it still didn't work.
I feel it was a lot of code for such a small component, so I'll try to do this same project again in the future by writing less code.
